# 1. Functional Needs (Requirements)
## What questions would you ask the librarians in regards to the functional needs (requirements) of the system?

1. **Current System Usage**: 
   - "Can I see a card and can you walk me through how you currently use your paper-based card catalog for lending and returning books?"
     
2. **Preferred Features**: 
   - "Are there any features from your current system that you really like? Why is that important?"
     
3. **Reservations and Hold Requests**: 
   - "How would you like the system to manage book reservations and hold requests? Are there any bottlenecks in your current system?"
     
4. **Lending Policies**: 
   - "What are your current policies for lending periods, renewals, and handling late fees?"
     
5. **Media Types**: 
   - "What kinds of media are in the system now, and what new types of media would you like the new system to support?"

6. **Extra**:
   - "Are there any other functional needs that I didn't cover above?"




# 2. UI/UX Requirements
## What questions would you ask the librarians in regards to the UI/UX requirements of the system?

1. **Interface Preferences**: 
   - "We have recommendations for clean and simple design, do you have any special requests?"
     
2. **User Experience**: 
   - "How should the system accommodate users with varying levels of tech-savviness? We design for accessibility, does your library have any special programs for people with different abilities?" 

3. **Search Functionality**: 
   - "How do you want the search functionality to work for finding books in the catalog? We will provide a drop-down bar to give a 'search by' function."
     
4. **Navigation Features**: 
   - "On a website, we have a menu that can help users navigate to different sections. As a librarian, what are the key topics you need to break down your library by?"
     
5. **Feedback and Customization**: 
   - "How should users (both the librarian and patrons) be able to provide feedback on the system? Should the system allow for customization by the library staff?"




# 3. Technical Requirements
## What questions would you ask the librarians in regards to the technical requirements of the system?
1. **System Integration**: 
   - "I'm sure you're familiar with the Integrated Library System (ILS). Are there any existing digital systems or databases that we need to be aware of or interact with that the new system needs to integrate with?"
     
2. **Data Migration**: 
   - "What are the data migration requirements from the current paper-based system to the new digital system? Do you already have some .MARC files for bibliogrpahic material (required for all)? Are you able to provide us with the card catalog data to transfer to an electronic system?"

3. **Compliance**:
   - "Are there state, city, or federal requirements that this library needs to follow?" 
     
3. **Security and Data Privacy**: 
   - "What are the security requirements for protecting patron data and book inventory information? How should the system handle authentication and authorization for librarians and patrons?"
     
4. **Scalability and Performance**: 
   - "When we design websites, there's a high traffic period and down time, think about it like traffic on a road. What are your operating hours? We'll have to create a screen for downtime and updates or decide to have continuous updates."
     
5. **Backup and Recovery**: 
   - "For data backup and recovery we have a standard to develop a system for failures and data loss?"




# 4. Transitional Requirements
## What questions would you ask the librarians in regards to the transitional requirements of the system (i.e. from catalog/paper-based system to software solution)?
1. **Change Management**: 
   - "What kind of training will be needed for the librarian to transition from the paper-based system to the new digital system? How should the transition be managed to minimize disruption to library operations?"
     
2. **Data Migration**: 
   - "How much historical data from the paper-based system needs to be digitized and migrated to the new system? What is the plan for verifying the accuracy of the data after migration?"
     
3. **Support and Maintenance**: 
   - "Support and maintenance will be required for the new system. Are there any specific requirements for user support, like helpdesk or tutorials?"
     
4. **Pilot Testing and Rollout**: 
   - "We've got two options. One is a phased rollout of the new system, starting with a pilot program. The other is a full-scale implementation. Which of the two at a glance seem like a better approach?




# Additionally:

## 1. SDLC Process
### Assuming that the client is unfamiliar with the SDLC process, how would you orient them to feel comfortable with the process, to ensure they feel at ease when discussing their challenges and voicing their opinions?
(planning :arrow_forward: design :arrow_forward: development :arrow_forward: testing :arrow_forward: deployment :arrow_forward: maintenance)
"We are currently in the planning phase. As part of discovery, it might seem like I'm asking a lot of questions, but I'm going to use that information to make sure the patrons neeeds' are met and the libary's needs are met to create the product you want as well as elevate the experience."

## 2. Stakeholder Disagreements
### What strategies would you utilize if there was disagreement between the stakeholders as to the ‘most important’ features in the system? Or how they should function?
I would ask each party and get a profile of where they're coming from; it's amazing what the smallest bit of communication can do. One exercise I sometimes employ is the 'MoSCoW prioritization' (Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won’t have), and that could help us reach a consensus.

## 3. Follow-Up Activities After the First Meeting
### After eliciting the high-level requirements on your first meeting, what follow-up activities would you perform to help prioritize the scope items they’ve discussed with you?
After the kickoff meeting, I’d create key extractions for the client. Once they review and confirm the document, I'd create a Product Requirement Document (PRD) summarizing what we discussed with user stories, a context diagram, and create a basic process flow of the desired system. 
### What thought exercises, or internal deliverables, would you produce to help clarify the ‘ask’ from the client for your colleagues?
I like to have some fun at work, so maybe I could put the steps into a framework of a "Quest" for gamification with my team as follows:

- Step 1: :earth_americas: World Map

   - Action: Draw a world map with all the requirements of all the levels the Readers Room needs to go to.

- Step 2: :suspect: Playable characters

   - Action: Emulate the "create a character" screen on a game. What do they like what are their stats? If I'm working with someone nerdy like me, it's ATP and INT. For someone a little more normal, I'll ask age, gender, likes and dislikes.

- Step 3: :crossed_swords: World map connections

   - Action: Tell me how each level on the map talks to the other levels. How does each character respond each level? What battles need to be won for each connection?

- Step 4: :fire: Campfire spots

   - Action: At each campfire rest spot, what information is needed before moving to the next level?

# Bonus:
## 1. **Unique Features**
### What ‘fun or exciting’ features could you propose to the librarians to set their library apart from the crowd?
I enjoy having the freedom to be creative, but not too creative. This is quesiton where I imagine people get the most unrealistic (in a good way!).

-What: Volunteer moderated online shared space similar to Zoom.
-Where: The "Reader Room" Portal"
-When: Business Hours
-Why: A space for to collaborate, talk about and write book reviews (with a [Submittable](https://www.submittable.com/) portal), friendly competition with others and leaderboards

## 2. **Feature Challenges**
### During your thought exercise (i.e. this task), what feature did you feel could pose the biggest challenge to the app being built successfully? What strategies would you recommend to manage the risks associated with that challenge?
My initial [research](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/digital-rights-management-drm) shows that the most challenging feature to implement would be to give security to the virtual reading rooms. It would be very cool to host live book clubs, author readings, and interactive discussions and uploading the element itself wouldn't be an issue, but the backend receives a lot of the technical complexity. To address these risks, I would start with a thorough feasibility study to understand the technical requirements and limitations. If for whatever reason, the library would decide they don't need to protect their your videos, then we'd use a player library or HTML5 video and static-host the video files with the UI only navigating and pointing to them. 

But the whole point of this project is we're trying to get them _out_ of the 19th century, and we'd still need to choose an format that encodes on all modern platforms and browsers. 

Implementing the feature in phases, beginning with simpler functionalities and gradually introducing live streaming, would help manage the complexity. Maybe we'd choose basic HTML5, standard video formats, and a fallback to some Java player using an object tag. Maybe it's even simpler though, and we simply leverage and established platform like Google Meet or Twitch which could ensure reliability and save development time. These would still have metrics allowing for grant writing. We'd continue to conduct user testing and gathering feedback, establishing support and maintenance, and continue to develp a risk management plan beyond the topics I've touched upon above.

## 3. **Operational Requirement Questions**
### What if any operational requirements questions would you ask the librarians?
I'd ask a lot of the same questions I've asked above, but will touch on the most important questions here.
- "How will access to the Reader Room be managed, and what policies would be in place to ensure fair and efficient use of the space?"
  
- What types of resources should be readily available in the Readers Room? How will these resources be organized and accessed by patrons?
  
- Most importantly, are there any other specific services or programs that you believe would enhance your patrons' experience in the Readers Room?
