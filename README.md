#### Skills Assessment - Business Analysis

## :large_orange_diamond: Overview
This project emulates my business analysts's (project/product manager) approach to modernizing a local library's inventory system from a paper-based card catalog to a digital solution. 
-Goal: Upgrade "paper-based card catalog"
-Initial Scope: Develop for "two roles in the system"
This project memorializes meeting one between TWC and the library representative and provides bonus content and plans
