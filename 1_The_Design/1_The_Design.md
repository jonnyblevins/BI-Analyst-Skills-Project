It is integral to this project to develop a demo of key screens to help visualize the system, because we all love a picture. 

This web application mockup provides a visual representation of the look and feel of the website and its capabilities which can be presented to the library clients.

LEGAL DISCLOSURE: Admittedly I am not a designer. Design falls in my strenghts and weakness matrix, but I always give it a go. 

Please see the [Wireframe](https://github.com/jonnyblevins/TWCSkillsAssessment/blob/main/3_The_Documentation/PrototypeWireframes.md) section for the website flow.
